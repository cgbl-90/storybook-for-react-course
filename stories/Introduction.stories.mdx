# Welcome to Storybook for React Apps

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

This is a [course](https://www.newline.co/courses/storybook-for-react-apps) which will show you how to unleash the full potential of Storybook in the context of React applications.
